Black Ops III FastFile Anti-Malware


##### How does the Report output work?
In order to determine the risk of a map/mod, the program splits alerts into three categories, and its overall result will be based on any instance of the most severe it finds.
* Safe (Green): The program did not detect anything suspicious. It is very unlikely that the map/mod has any malicious content.
* Warning (Yellow/Amber): The program detected one or more functions that can be used in malicious ways, but they can also be used in reasonable ways. It's worth the user being aware of their use, however in many cases the map/mod is likely to still be safe to play.
* Alert (Red): The program detected one or more functions that are risky and/or likely to be used in a malicious way, and so the user should be very cautious about whether or not they should play the map/mod.
